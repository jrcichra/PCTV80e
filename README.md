## PCTV80e 2020

See my issue on patrick's page: https://github.com/patrickdickey52761/PCTV80e/issues/2

Essentially all you need to do for modern kernels is cd to /lib/firmware and run `sudo wget https://github.com/osmc/dvb-firmware-osmc/raw/master/dvb-fe-drxj-mc-1.0.8.fw`. There might be newer versions you can download from here: https://www.linuxtv.org/downloads/firmware/

No need to clone this repo.
